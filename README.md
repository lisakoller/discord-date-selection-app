# Discord-Date-Selection-Bot

Just my first try making a bot for Discord. It's intended for me and a bunch of friends, therefore the text in the embeds is currently only available in German. The slashcommands themselves as well as all instructions are in English too.

## Usable commands

- `ping`
- `dice`
- `random`
- `reminder`
- `session`

## How to run it locally

1. `npm i`
1. `node deploy-commands.js`
1. `node .`

## Requires (.env)

- Discord Bot Token
- ID of the guild the bot is used in
- ID of the bot
- AWS Key and AWS Secret Key
