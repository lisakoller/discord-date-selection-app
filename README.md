# Discord-Date-Selection-Bot

Just my first try making a bot for Discord. It's intended for me and a bunch of friends, therefore the text is only in German. 

## How to run it locally

1. `npm i`
1. `node .`

## How to update and deploy it

- `git push origin master`
- `git push heroku master`
- `git push github master`
